    <h1>All About Custom PC</h1>
    <p>
    Personal computers, or PCs, are now a standard tool in everyday life, with a penetration rate of almost 80 percent in U.S. households as of 2013. PCs originally emerged in the form of desktop computers, which were small enough to sit in the family home or an office, but were hardly portable. However, the definition has since been expanded to include laptops, notebooks, netbooks and, since 2010, often includes tablet PCs (or simply 'tablets') and other hand-held computers.

The process of building your own computer can look awfully technical and intimidating. Buying a variety of components and carefully combining them into a finished product seems a bit much, but it's not as hard as it looks. Building a computer basically involves snapping together premade components
</p>
<p>
Here are the components you'll need to build your first gaming PC.
Processor. Your central processing unit, or CPU, is often referred to as the computer's brain. ...
The motherboard houses the various components of your gaming PC. ...
Memory. ...
Graphics processing unit. ...
Storage. ...
Power supply. ...
Case.

    <h1>PC Building Tips for Beginners</h1>
    
    <p>1. Before you do anything, determine the purpose of your build.

What’s the reason you’re making this PC? Is it because you want the ultimate gaming machine? Are you looking for something that can handle your creative work, or just want a build that can manage common web browsing? Or do you want a machine that’s as flashy as a nightclub? Maybe it’s a combination of these. In any case, your motivations will influence your decisions when shopping for components.</p>

<p>2. Pick a side: Intel or AMD.

Do your research on which CPU has the power and specs you need for your dream build. The CPU will be the core of your PC, so your selection is a very important decision. But it’s not the only component in your computer, so don’t blow your entire budget on it.

In short, you can’t wrong with either brand, but which model you choose will determine what kind of motherboard you can get. For help selecting a CPU, make sure to check out our CPU buying guide and our best picks for gaming and performance. Our CPU Hierarchy ranks all current chips from fastest to slowest. The video below also features some quick tips for CPU shopping.</p>

<p>3. Consider a cooler with thermal paste included. 

    Using thermal paste can be a messy ordeal, especially for first-time builders. It also adds an extra step to the process. If you'd like to simplify things, opt for a cooler that offers pre-applied thermal paste.</p>

<p>4. Make sure all the components you buy are compatible with one another…and your budget.

Components come in many different flavors from various vendors, and not all of them play well together. For example, you will hit a roadblock if you find out your motherboard doesn’t have the right type of socket for your CPU or an M.2 slot for your speedy SSD.

Make sure you’re building a PC symphony comprised of components that perform together harmoniously, not a discordant, mismatched group of parts that literally won’t play a thing. Again, there are resources to help guide you to the right choices, including our motherboard, SSD and PSU buying guides.

    If you have a limited budget and splurge most of that on a high-grade CPU or graphics card, for instance, you’re going to be SOL when it’s time to get a motherboard or key additions, like an SSD. Don’t forget to check out our best picks, from budget to premium, for each component for some solid recommendations:</p>
<p>
5. Open each component carefully.

Components are fragile and can break before you even install them. Ripping open the packaging on your CPU can lead to bent pins, as an example, and any damaged component may very well result in a non-functioning build. </p>
<p>
 6. No socks on a carpet.

Beware of static electricity. A static discharge can destroy expensive components. To be safe in high-static environments, you can use an anti-static wrist strap or simply touch a metal object that’s not part of the computer before you begin work.   
</p>
<p>
  7. Keep the Band-Aids close.

Some cheaper cases have sharp edges, which mean it’s possible to cut yourself. Consider it a badge of honor, but keep the first-aid kit nearby.
