      <section id="sectionMine"><p>But, we know that Starting Out in Sim Racing isn't easy. Lots of people struggle to get started, and it's because of these 3 main reasons:

1) There is A LOT of choice. Sim Racing has become extremely popular in recent years, so there are a lot of products in the market. It's very easy to get confused and not know which product is best for you.

2) Most of the products are expensive! Most racing wheels cost from £200, and Direct Drive wheels start from £800, up to well over £2,000; a decent sim racing cockpit starts from £500, and accessories cost from at least £100 each! Add it all up, and you realise you have spent a lot of money! You want to spend your money well, and not waste money on something you don't need.

3) Compatibility. The amount of different products that aren't compatible with each other is insane. Whether it's a wheel that works only on a specific console, or a rim that won't fit, shifter or a rig (we sometimes say rig, other times we say sim racing cockpit, they mean the same thing) with pre-drilled holes for specific brands - you need to consider all of this when deciding what you buy. 

Ultimately, it makes choosing what you want really difficult.</p>

    <h>First, choose your Games</h1>
    <p>If you're a keen sim racer, who wants the ultimate racing simulator, with true-to-life physics, then Assetto Corsa Competizione, rFactor 2, Automobilista, KartKraft, RaceRoom Racing Experience and iRacing are the best games for this. These are all PC games available on Steam (though iRacing is a membership-based game, so Steam only sells fixed-time memberships).</p>
    <p>If you have a PS4, then Gran Turismo Sport is the king of racing simulation, but also F1 2019, Project Cars 2 and Dirt Rally 2.0 are all good games.</p>
    <p>Likewise if you have an Xbox One, then Forza 7 is the king of racing games. But again, F1 2019, Project Cars 2 and Dirt Rally 2.0 are all good games. Forza Horizon 4 is less of a simulation racer, but is still great fun with a racing wheel and is so popular we had to include it - and it is certainly far more realistic than the likes of Need for Speed and Burnout.</p>
    <p>The games you buy will depend on the platform(s) that you have: PC, PS4 and Xbox. Some games are available on all platforms (e.g. F1 2019) whilst others are only available on one platform (e.g. GT Sport, iRacing etc.). </p>
    <p>Now you know what games you want and so what platforms you will be using, this lets you decide what racing wheel & accessories you will buy....</p>
